key pressed: `ssh<space>gezhang@ieng6-202.ucsd.edu<enter>`.<br>
This line is used to help me to log into ieng6 with the help of typing my own account followed by `ssh`.<br>
## step 5 
![image2](labreport4.2.png)
key pressed: `git<space>clone<space>git@github.com:ZGXJason/lab7.git<enter>`.<br>
This line is used to clone everything in `lab7` from my github to the remote accout. `git@github.com:ZGXJason/lab7.git` is the `SSH` URL for the `lab7` of my fork. <br>
## step 6
![image3](labreport4.3.png)
key pressed:<br> 
`cd<space>la<tab><enter>`<br>
`ls<enter>`<br>
`bash<space>te<tab>`<br>
In order to run the test, I have to first change my directory to the `lab7`, and that is the reason I pressed `cd<space>la<tab><enter>`. Since there is only one directory begin with letter `la`, I only need to press `la` then press `<tab>`. After that, in order to find the file for the test, I have to list all the files, that is the reason I pressed `ls<enter>`. Then, in order to run the test, I pressed `bash<space>te<tab>`. Also, since there is only one file begin with letter `te`, I only need to press `bash<space>te<tab><enter>`. After that, the test would run, and show there is an error.<br>
